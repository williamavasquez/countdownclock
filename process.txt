have some html that shows a clock
we take in a value (hours)
convert to minutes 
Display the timer - front end 
reduce the time by seconds 
altering the html to show the clock ticking down 
when submiting there should be a check between backend timer and front to make sure no alterations were made
route should return if this comparison is true or not
the clock needs to restart itself once the timer is over 
route that creates a new clock with a new countdown
